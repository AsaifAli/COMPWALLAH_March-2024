## Task 2:-
### EDA the Fun Way with Matplotlib:-
We have explored how to use both the Plotly and Seaborn libraries in the preceding projects. Plots from these libraries are very business-like. Sometimes, we just want to make fun data science projects. 
In this data science project, we will learn how to perform EDA the fun way with the **xkcd** function in the Matplotlib library. 
## Task 3:-
### Health Insurance Premium Prediction using Python:-
The amount of the premium for a health insurance policy depends from person to person, as many factors affect the amount of the premium for a health insurance policy. Letâ€™s say age, a young person is very less likely to have major health problems compared to an older person. Thus, treating an older person will be expensive compared to a young one. That is why an older person is required to pay a high premium compared to a young person.
